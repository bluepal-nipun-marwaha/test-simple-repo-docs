## Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations with an interactive interface, now including the newly added factorial operation feature for enhanced functionality and user experience in calculations. The application continues to offer calculation history tracking along with comprehensive error handling mechanisms. It maintains its commitment to being easy-to-use through a command-line menu system.

## Features
The Calculator Application now includes:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (existing)
- **Advanced Operations**: Power/exponentiation and Factorial operation for more complex calculations
- **Calculation History Tracking**: Continue to track all previous user operations with the addition of factorial entries. Users can review their calculation history at any time.
- **Error Handling Framework**: The application's robust error handling framework now includes graceful management of invalid inputs and division by zero, ensuring a seamless experience even when encountering incorrect or impossible calculations like attempting to calculate the factorial for non-integer values without proper input validation.
- **Interactive Menu Options**: Users can navigate through various calculator features using an easy-to-use command-line interface menu system (existing)

## Installation
(No changes in this section as per instruction.)

## Usage
To use the Calculator Application, follow these steps...
(The usage instructions remain unchanged from before; however, include a brief mention of how to access and utilize factorial calculations if necessary for clarity. If not already present, add: "For accessing advanced operations like power/exponentiation or calculating factorials, please refer to the 'Menu Options' section.")

## Calculator Operations
(No changes in this section as per instruction.)

## Menu Options
- (Existing menu options remain unchanged; however, include an additional option for users who want to calculate a numberâ€™s factorial. For example: "9. Factorial Operation")
  1. Addition (+) 2. Subtraction (-) ... [existing operations] ... 9. Calculate the factorial of a given number (e.g., '5!')
- To calculate and view your calculation history, including any recent factorial calculations: "To review all previous calculator operations with their results, navigate to option #8."
  
## Error Handling Framework
(No changes in this section as per instruction.)

## History Management
The Calculator Application now includes a comprehensive tracking of the user's calculation history. This feature has been enhanced by incorporating entries for factorial calculations into your historical data, providing an extensive record that reflects all operations performed within the application. Users can easily access their complete operation log at any time to review past results or perform further analysis on them if desired.
