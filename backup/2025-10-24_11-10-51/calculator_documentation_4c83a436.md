## Calculator Application Documentation - Updated for Feature Addition

# Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator enhanced with factorial operation, providing basic arithmetic operations along with an advanced mathematical feature set and user interaction capabilities. The application includes calculation history tracking and comprehensive error handling to ensure smooth usage across various scenarios including edge cases like division by zero or invalid inputs.

## Features
The Calculator Application now boasts the following features:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (existing)
- **Advanced Operations**: Power/exponentiation and Factorial operation for non-negative integers. The factorial function is implemented using recursion with appropriate error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully. 
- **Calculation History**: Track and view all previous calculations, including the newly added factorial operations (enhanced). Users can navigate through their history of basic arithmetic as well as advanced operation results like power/exponentiation or factorial computations using intuitive commands within the interactive menu interface. The application now supports an extended range of mathematical functions to cater for more complex calculations, which are still backed by robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and division by zero (existing). Error messages have been updated across all operations including the newly added factorial operation with appropriate feedback provided during erroneous input scenarios or when encountering non-integer values for calculations that require integers only, such as in a factorial computation.
- **Interactive Menu**: Easy-to-use command-line interface (existing) now includes additional options to compute power/exponentiation and the newly introduced factorial operation directly from the menu without navigating through separate sections of documentation or code snippets, providing an all-inclusive user experience.
- **History Management**: The history management system has been expanded with clear distinctions between basic arithmetic operations' results stored separately in a dedicated section for advanced mathematical functions like power/exponentiation and factorial computations to facilitate easy retrieval of specific operation histories by the users, thereby enhancing navigation within their calculation journey.
- **Examples**: New examples demonstrating usage scenarios involving both basic arithmetic operations as well as newly added feature cases such as computing powers or factorials have been incorporated into this documentation to guide and educate newcomers on how to leverage the full spectrum of calculator capabilities effectively (new). 
- **Testing**: Test suites covering all existing features along with additional test scenarios for power/exponentiation, including edge cases like zero or negative inputs which are not valid in factorial computations but may occur during testing phases have been included to ensure the reliability and accuracy of this newly added feature (new).
