### Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations along with an advanced factorial operation feature for users to calculate large numbers efficiently. It includes calculation history tracking and comprehensive error handling while maintaining its user-friendly interactive interface. The addition of the factorial function extends our application's functionality, allowing it to serve a broader range of mathematical needs beyond simple arithmetic tasks.

### Features (Updated)
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Advanced Factorial Operation**: Calculate factorial for non-negative integers using an efficient algorithm to handle large numbers without overflow issues
- **Calculation History Tracking**: Record and view all previous calculations (including the new factorial operation) with ease of navigation through history entries. 
- **Error Handling Framework**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs, division by zero errors, as well as informative error messages for unsupported operations or incorrect input formats.
- **Interactive Menu Interface**: Easy to use command-line interface that now includes an option to calculate factorials in addition to basic arithmetic tasks.
