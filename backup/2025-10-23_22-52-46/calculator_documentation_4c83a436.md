## Executive Summary
This documentation has been updated following a recent commit that introduced additional functionality, including factorial operations and enhanced error handling mechanisms into our Python-based command-line calculator application. This update provides users with an extended set of features while maintaining the user-friendly interactive interface previously established in version [previous version number].

## Introduction and Overview (Updated)
The Calculator Application continues to be a robust, open-source tool designed for executing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with graceful error handling. With the recent commit by bluepal-nipun-marwaha on [date of last update], we've expanded our calculator capabilities into advanced mathematical functions like factorial and power calculations while ensuring a seamless user experience through an interactive menu interface that tracks calculation history for reference purposes.

## System Architecture (Unchanged)
[Provide details about the system architecture if necessary]

## Feature Specifications - Updated with New Operations
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division [unchanged content].
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions** (New): Power/exponentiation and factorial operations. The calculator now supports calculating the nth power of a number as well as computing factorial values for integers using recursion or iteration methods where appropriate to optimize performance based on input size.
- [Additional features if necessary]

## User Interface Design (Unchanged)
[Provide details about user interface design and interaction flow with new changes highlighted, if any.]

## Technical Implementation Details for the Factorial Operation (New Section Added)
The factorial operation has been implemented using a recursive approach to calculate n! where 'n' is an integer input. The function `factorial(n)` returns the product of all positive integers up to and including that number, with special handling when negative numbers are entered or non-integer values provided as inputs for error checking before attempting any calculation.

## Error Handling Framework Enhancements (Updated)
The application now includes comprehensive input validation across its operations: it checks if the user's entry is a valid integer and handles division by zero errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages to guide users towards correct usage of calculator functions without terminating unexpectedly. The error handling framework has been updated in line with these changes for consistency throughout all features.

## Testing Strategy (Updated)
Unit tests have been added specifically targeting the newly introduced factorial and power operations, ensuring that they function correctly across a range of inputs including edge cases such as zero or negative numbers where applicable within our calculator's logic constraints. These unit tests are part of an ongoing process to maintain high-quality standards for all features in this application.

## History Management Updates and Examples (Updated)
The history management section has been expanded with examples demonstrating the recording, viewing, and navigating through calculation histories that now include factorial operations alongside basic arithmetic calculations. These historical records are maintained within a session-specific context to ensure data persistence between uses of our calculator application for educational or reference purposes by users.

## Documentation of Installation Process (Updated)
[Provide updated installation instructions if necessary, detailing any changes made due to the new feature addition.]
