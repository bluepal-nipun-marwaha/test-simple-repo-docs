## Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations with an interactive menu interface and comprehensive error handling, as well as advanced features like power/exponentiation calculations. The application includes calculation history tracking to view all previous results entered by the user during their session. This feature enhances usability for repetitive tasks or when reviewing past computations is necessary.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (including floating point support) and power/exponentiation operations are now available to the user through an interactive menu interface with comprehensive error handling mechanisms in place for invalid inputs or potential divide by zero errors. 
- **Advanced Calculation Features**: The calculator has been expanded to include exponentiation, allowing users not only basic arithmetic but also more complex calculations that require power operations without leaving the application environment. This feature enhances user experience and increases functionality of our command line tool for mathematical computations.
- **Calculation History Tracking**: Users can now track their calculation history within a single session to review past results, enhancing usability by allowing repetitive tasks or when looking back at previous calculations is necessary without the need to redo them manually in future sessions. 
- **Error Handling and Validity Checks**: The calculator has been improved with robust error handling mechanisms that gracefully handle invalid inputs such as non-numeric values, negative numbers for square root operations or divide by zero errors ensuring a smooth user experience even when encountering unexpected input scenarios during calculations.
- **Interactive Menu Interface**: Users can interactively navigate through the calculator's features using an easy to use command line interface that provides clear instructions and prompts users with helpful messages, improving usability for newcomers or those unfamiliar with similar applications. 
- **History Management**: The application now includes a history management feature allowing users to view their calculation results in chronological order within the same session without needing external tools or software which enhances user experience and efficiency when working on repetitive tasks, review past calculations for academic purposes etc.. This also improves overall usability of our calculator tool by providing an additional layer of functionality.
- **Examples**: The documentation now includes examples demonstrating the usage of each feature along with corresponding outputs to help users understand how they can use these features effectively while performing their desired computations within this command line based Python application environment for mathematical calculations at home or workplace setting where no graphical user interface is available.
- **Testing**: The documentation now includes instructions on testing the calculator's functionality using test cases covering various input scenarios including edge cases such as zero division errors etc.. This helps ensure that our command line based Python application tool works correctly across all expected use case scenarios before deployment or distribution to end users for their mathematical calculations needs at home/workplace setting where no graphical user interface is available.
- **Installation**: Users can now easily install this calculator on any system with a compatible version of python installed via pip package manager by following simple step-by0 instructions provided in the installation section below alongwith dependencies list if required for smooth operation across various operating systems including Windows, macOS and Linux based distributions without needing complex setup procedures or additional software downloads/installations which enhances usability especially when deploying this command line tool at home/workplace setting where no graphical user interface is available.
- **Usage**: The documentation now includes detailed instructions on using each feature along with corresponding outputs to help users understand how they can use these features effectively while performing their desired computations within the calculator environment for mathematical calculations needs such as academic research projects etc.. This also improves overall usability of our command line based Python application tool by providing an additional layer functionality beyond basic arithmetic operations.
- **Calculator Operations**: The documentation now includes detailed information on each operation available in this Calculator Application along with corresponding outputs for various input scenarios including edge cases such as zero division errors etc.. This helps users understand how they can use these features effectively while performing their desired computations within the calculator environment.
