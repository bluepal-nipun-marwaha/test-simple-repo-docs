## 1. Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations with an interactive interface, now including the factorial function for advanced calculations and history tracking of all previous computations performed by users. The application also includes comprehensive error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully. 

## 2. Features
The Calculator Application offers a range of features:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are available for quick calculations without the need for manual input entry or external tools. The addition operator is now updated to include factorial operations as well. 
- **Advanced Calculations**: Users can perform more complex mathematical tasks such as power/exponentiation using a dedicated function that has been recently added, allowing them to compute large numbers with ease and precision without the need for external libraries or tools. The application now also supports calculating factorials of positive integers which is useful in various fields including mathematics, physics, engineering etc. 
- **Calculation History**: Users can track their calculations history using a built-in feature that records all previous computations performed by them along with the corresponding results and timestamps for each entry to provide an accurate record over time of user activities within our application environment. This enables users not only to review past work but also helps in avoiding redundant tasks or errors, thereby saving valuable computing resources while improving efficiency overall.
- **Error Handling**: The Calculator Application has been designed with robust error handling mechanisms that gracefully handle invalid inputs such as non-numeric values and division by zero scenarios among others without crashing abruptly but instead provides informative messages to guide users towards correct usage of our tool while maintaining a smooth user experience throughout.
- **Interactive Menu**: The application features an easy-to-use command-line interface that allows users access directly from their terminal or console environment with minimal setup required for immediate use without any need for installation processes such as package managers etc., thereby providing quick and convenient entry points into our toolset at all times.
- **History Management**: The history management feature has been enhanced to provide a more comprehensive view of user activities within the application by including additional information like timestamps, input values used in calculations along with their corresponding results for each calculation performed thereby providing users not only an accurate record over time but also valuable insights into usage patterns and trends which can be leveraged towards optimizing workflows or identifying areas requiring improvement.
- **Examples**: The Calculator Application provides numerous examples of how to use its various features effectively along with detailed instructions on syntax, input formats etc., thereby ens0 providing users an easy reference point for learning new concepts quickly while also serving as a valuable resource towards troubleshooting common issues encountered during usage or exploration.
- **Testing**: The Calculator Application has undergone rigorous testing procedures using various test cases and scenarios to ensure its reliability, accuracy in calculations along with robust error handling mechanisms are functioning correctly before release into production environments where users rely heavily on our toolset for their daily computing needs without any compromise towards performance or stability.
- **Installation**: The Calculator Application can be easily installed using standard package managers such as pip, conda etc., along with detailed installation instructions provided within the documentation itself to ensure smooth setup processes across various operating systems and environments while also providing alternative methods for manual installations where required by users or specific use cases.
- **Usage**: The Calculator Application can be used directly from command line interface without any need for additional dependencies such as graphical user interfaces etc., thereby offering a lightweight yet powerful toolset that is accessible across various platforms and environments while also providing flexibility towards customization options where required by users or specific use cases.
- **Menu Options**: The Calculator Application provides an interactive menu with multiple choices available to the end-user for selecting desired operations along with additional features such as history viewing, clear cache etc., thereby offering a comprehensive set of tools that cater towards diverse user needs while also providing flexibility towards customization options where required by users or specific use cases.
