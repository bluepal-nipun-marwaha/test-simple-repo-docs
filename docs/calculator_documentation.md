## Calculator Operations (Updated Section Below)
The calculator now supports a variety of operations, including:
6. Technical Implementation Details for Basic Arithmetic and Advanced Power/Exponentiation Functions
7. Factorial Operation: Now available to calculate the factorial of an integer number using recursion or iterative methods with error handling in case non-integer inputs are provided. 
8. Calculation History Tracking - Updated documentation on how history is recorded, including entries for new operations like factorial and power functions.
9. Error Handling (Updated Section Below) - Details of graceful management when invalid input or division by zero occurs with the inclusion of errors specific to non-integer inputs in the Factorial operation section as well as any other potential issues that may arise from using this new feature. 
10. Usage Instructions for all operations, including how to use and navigate through menu options which now include an option number "3" - Newly added factorial calculation function within our interactive command-line interface.

## Menu Options (Addition of Factorial Operation)
2 | Addition | ... 
...
4 | Subtraction | ... 
5 | Multiplication | ...
6 | Division | ...
7 | Power/Exponentiation | Calculates the power or exponentiation of a number. Example: `3^2 = 9`
8. Factorial Operation - Newly added menu option to calculate factorial using recursion (`factorial(n)`) and iterative methods (using loops). Error handling for non-integer inputs is also included, ensuring the application remains user friendly even with incorrect usage of this new feature.
... 

## Error Handling (Updated Section Below)
The error handling section has been expanded to include:
- Non-integer input errors specific to factorial operations where only integer values are expected. This includes informative messages guiding the users towards valid inputs for such advanced calculations as well as general guidance on how incorrect usage of menu options is handled gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience even when mistakes occur during operation execution or history management tasks.
... 

## Examples (Updated Section Below)
Examples are now updated to include the factorial calculation:
- Example for Factorial Operation - `5! = 120` demonstrating how to calculate and display results using our application's interactive menu options, including navigating through history entries that feature this new operation.
... 

## Testing (Updated Section Below)
Test cases have been updated or added for the factorial function as well as any other changes made during recent commits such as error handling improvements and enhancements to calculation speed where applicable. These tests ensure our application remains robust, efficient in performance with new features like advanced operations including power/exponentiation calculations while maintaining a user-friendly experience through proper input validation and helpful feedback mechanisms for errors encountered by users during operation execution or history management tasks.
