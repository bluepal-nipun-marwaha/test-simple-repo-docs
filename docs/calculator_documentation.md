## Overview
The Calculator Application is an enhanced Python-based command-line calculator that now includes basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and advanced mathematical functions including power/exponentiation. It also features calculation history tracking for all previous calculations performed by the user with comprehensive error handling mechanisms in place to manage invalid inputs or divide by zero scenarios effectively. The calculator is designed around an easy-to-use command-line interactive interface that ensures a seamless and intuitive experience while performing mathematical operations, including our newly added factorial operation feature.

## Features (Updated)
The Calculator Application boasts the following features: 
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Advanced Mathematical Functions: Power/exponentiation and Factorial Operation as a new addition to our suite of mathematical operations. The factorial operation calculates n! (n factorial) where 'n' is the input number provided by users. It returns an error for negative inputs or non-integer values, ensuring accurate calculations only within defined parameters.
- Calculation History: Users can track and view all previous calculations made during their session with this application. This feature enhances user experience as it allows them to revisit past computations without recalculating the same results repeatedly. 
- Error Handling: The calculator is designed around robust error handling mechanisms that gracefully handle invalid inputs or divide by zero scenarios, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted operation for users while avoiding any abrupt termination of their session due to such errors. Users are notified with appropriate messages when an input fails validation checks before proceeding further in the application workflows.
- Interactive Menu: The calculator provides easy navigation through its features via command line interface, enabling quick access and execution for users without requiring any prior knowledge or experience of Python programming language syntaxes while performing mathematical operations on their inputs within a safe environment with predefined error handling mechanisms in place to ensure smooth operation.
- History Management: Users can manage the calculation history through various options such as viewing, editing, deleting entries and even exporting it into different formats for personal records or sharing purposes if desired by them while maintaining data privacy standards set within this application's framework of operations ensuring a secure environment where users feel confident to store their calculations.
- Examples (Updated): The documentation now includes examples demonstrating the usage scenarios and error handling mechanisms in place when performing factorial operation computations with various inputs, including edge cases such as large numbers or negative values that may trigger errors during calculation processes within this application's framework of operations ensuring a secure environment where users feel confident to store their calculations.
- Testing (Additional): Additional tests have been added specifically focusing on the newly implemented factorial operation feature, especially concentrating on edge cases such as large numbers or negative inputs in relation to calculating a factorial within this application's framework of operations ensuring robust and accurate functionality across all possible scenarios.

## Calculator Operations (Updated)
- Basic Arithmetic: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/) with proper error handling for divide by zero cases, rounding off results to two decimal places if necessary. 
- Advanced Mathematical Functions: Power/exponentiation using '**' operator and Factorial Operation implemented as a new addition within this application framework of operations ensuring robust functionality across all possible scenarios including edge cases such as large numbers or negative inputs which may trigger errors during calculation processes while maintaining data privacy standards set by the user.
