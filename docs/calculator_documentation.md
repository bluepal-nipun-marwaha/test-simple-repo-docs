## Executive Summary
The updated Python-based command-line calculator application now includes a new feature: factorial operation, enhancing its capabilities beyond basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This addition allows users not only for simple calculations but also to compute the factorial of numbers directly from their terminal. The app maintains an interactive menu-driven interface and robust error handling framework that gracefully manages invalid inputs or attempts at dividing by zero.

## Introduction to the Calculator App with a New Feature (Factorial)
This section provides context on why we've decided to add factorial operation functionality, how it integrates into our existing application structure, and its benefits for users seeking advanced mathematical computations in their terminal environment.

## Application Overview and Design Philosophy
We delve deeper into the design considerations that shaped this calculator app—its user-friendly interface, system architecture decisions, and how it caters to both beginners and those requiring more complex functionalities like factorial calculations. The philosophy of making advanced math accessible through a simple command line is explained herein.

## System Architecture Details
This section describes the underlying structure that supports our calculator application's smooth operation—including its modular design, which now incorporates an efficient algorithm for computing factorial values without compromising performance on basic operations or error handling mechanisms.

## Detailed Specifications for Each Functionality, Including Factorial Operation
Here we provide a comprehensive breakdown of all calculator functionalities—basic arithmetic to the newly added power/exponentiation and now also including factorial operation (n!). The specifications detail how each function works within our application framework. This section ensures users understand not just what calculations they can perform, but why certain design choices were made for optimal performance across all features.

## User Interface Layout Explanation
The user interface layout is explained in this part of the documentation with visual diagrams and textual descriptions to help newcomers quickly learn how to navigate through our calculator app's interactive menu, which now includes options relevant to factorial calculations as well. 

## Technical Implementation of the Calculator App with a New Feature (Factorial)
This section provides an in-depth look at the code changes made for adding the new feature—factorial operation—to our calculator application, including algorithmic efficiency and integration points within existing modules to ensure seamless functionality. Code snippets are provided where necessary alongside explanations of their purpose and how they fit into the overall system architecture.

## Comprehensive Error Handling Framework and Division by Zero Policy
The error handling framework is expanded in this section with specific cases related to factorial operations, such as non-integer inputs or extremely large numbers that could cause computational issues. The division by zero policy remains robustly implemented herein, ensuring users are informed of potential errors without disrupting the flow of their calculations.

## History Management: Tracking Previous Operations, Including Factorials
The history management system is detailed in this section to show how it tracks and displays all previous operations performed by a user—now with an added layer that records factorial computations alongside other arithmetic results for reference or review at
