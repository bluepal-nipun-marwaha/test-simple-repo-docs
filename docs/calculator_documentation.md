## Overview

The Calculator Application remains a Python-based command-line tool designed for performing basic arithmetic operations with an interactive menu interface, now enhanced to include the factorial operation. It continues its commitment to providing users with calculation history tracking and robust error handling mechanisms while ens012ing user experience by maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (as previously documented)
- **Advanced Operations**: Power/exponentiation and Factorial Operation using recursion for non-negative integers only; negative inputs are handled with user feedback.
- **Calculation History Tracking**: Users can view their calculation history to review past operations performed within the application, facilitating a better understanding of usage patterns over time.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator provides friendly error messages for invalid input types and division by zero attempts while ensuring users are guided towards correct operation use without frustration or confusion.
- **Interactive Menu Interface**: Maintains an easy-to-use command-line interface, allowing quick access to all available operations including the newly added factorial feature.

## Calculator Operations

### Factorial Operation
Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion and raises errors for negative inputs or inappropriate data types (e.g., strings, floating points). The operation is documented with an example to illustrate its use within various scenarios encountered by users during their interaction with the calculator application. 

### Power/Exponentiation Operation
(Previous documentation content remains unchanged)
