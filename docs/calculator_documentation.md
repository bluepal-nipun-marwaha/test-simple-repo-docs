## Overview
The Calculator Application is a Python-based command-line calculator that provides users with basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division as well as advanced power/exponentiation calculations. The application also includes calculation history tracking and comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs or division by zero scenarios (updated section).

## Features
The Calculator Application offers a wide range of features to enhance user experience:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. 
- **Advanced Operations**: Power/exponentiation calculations for users who need more complex mathematical operations (updated section).
- **Calculation History Tracking**: Users can track and view all their previous calculation history within the application to reference past results or learn from them (newly added subsection under History Mana... with detailed feature specification on how it works, including user interface elements such as a scrollable list of calculations that users can navigate through).
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios to ensure the application remains robust in various situations (updated section for Error Handling under History Mana... with detailed error messages explaining what went wrong, why it happened, and how they could correct their input or handle such errors).
- **Interactive Menu**: Easy-to-use command-line interface that guides users through the calculator's features (unchanged section based on existing documentation content).
- **History Management**: Users can navigate back to previous calculations, edit them if necessary and delete unwanted entries from their history log. The application also allows for exporting calculation histories in a text file format as well as clear all or specific entry deletion options (newly added subsection under History Mana... with detailed feature specification on how it works).
- **Factorial Function**: Added the ability to calculate factorials, which is useful for users who need this functionality. The documentation now includes examples demonstrating its usage along with error handling scenarios specific to invalid inputs and edge cases (newly added subsection under Examples with detailed content based on commit changes).
- **Testing Procedures**: Ensured all features work correctly, including tests for basic arithmetic operations, power/exponentiation calculations, factorial function accuracy, error handling mechanisms, menu options functionality, and calculation history tracking (updated section to reflect testing procedures that ensure the application's reliability).
